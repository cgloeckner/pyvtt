# pyvtt
Python-based Virtual Tabletop Tool

## What is this?

This piece of software is the engine behind the [Index Card Virtual Tabletop (ICVTT)](https://icvtt.net). It's mostly designed for playing variations of _Index Card RPG_ (ICRPG) by [Runehammer Games](http://runehammer.online) but can be used with other tabletop games (like _WAR|MAKER_, also by Runehammer Games).

See the wiki for more details.

# Docker
This application includes a simple Dockerfile to build a runnable container.

`./script/build.sh` will build an image for you. This script accepts one optional parameter: a tag to apply to the resultant image. If no tag is specified, `latest` will be used.

`./script/run.sh` will (re)start the image. It takes three optional parameters: the tag to use, the port to use, and the path to the location to mount into the container. The default values are `latest`, `8080`, and `/opt/pyvtt/prod` respectively.
